This project is a pixel-perfect spreadsheet web application inspired by modern tools like Google Sheets. It features a clean, responsive user interface that allows adding and removing columns, renaming columns, and editing cell values.
React tsx is used for development of this platform , along with use of libraries like shadcn
Tried to add basic functionalities to avoid Dead UI.
Added feature like navigation in cells through arrow keys, column resizing and hiding.
